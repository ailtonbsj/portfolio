<p>CREDE ERP aims to assist various processes in Regional Education Coordinators. The main features initially implemented were to manage users and institutions and provide an authentication and granular authorization system.</p>
<p>To facilitate access the users can log in using credentials or with Google button login. The user management has concepts of roles and permissions implemented with Spring Security.</p>
<p>I developed the backend using Spring Boot with PostgreSQL and for the frontend, I used Angular and Material Design.</p>
<p>I deployed the backend application on Oracle Cloud using a VPS with Linux and TomCat with SSL. The frontend bundle was deployed on Firebase and has utilize a JWT token to provide authentication.</p>
<p>I implemented a new module to manage the places and assets of the institution, avoiding the collision of schedules by sending automatic messages to Google Calendar and Whatsapp groups using technologies like Server-Sent Events and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
