<p>At university I started to give importance to study of english and I decided to increase my immersion in this language by studying on the bus when I was returning to home. At the time, there was no Duolingo and I needed an offline app to practice.</p>
<p>So I started to learn Android development to create an app to help me improve english skills.</p>
<p>I decide to create using Java with TextToSpeech API (TTS) available on Android system, so than I could practice listening, reading and translation. I took a book with 1000 most phrases speaked in english and I converted in JSON.</p>
<p>As result I developed an offline app using Android Developer Tools (ADT Eclipse base) and Java Android API with native components for Android 4.0. The app has feature to translate from english to portuguese and use voice synthesis.</p>

<p>With this app you can train your english doing phrases translations and training your hearing. The app use Android native voice synthesis and a lot of phrases with the most used english words.</p>
