<p>At university, I started to give importance to the study of English and I decided to increase my immersion in this language by studying on the bus when I was returning home. At the time, there was no Duolingo and I needed an offline app to practice.</p>
<p>So I started to learn Android development to create an app to help me improve my English skills.</p>
<p>I decided to create using Java with TextToSpeech API (TTS) available on the Android system, so I could practice listening, reading, and translation. I took a book with the thousand most phrases spoken in English and I converted it into JSON.</p>
<p>As a result I developed an offline app using Android Developer Tools (ADT Eclipse base) and Java Android API with native components for Android 4.0. The app has the feature to translate from English to Portuguese and use voice synthesis.</p>
