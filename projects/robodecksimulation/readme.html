<p>When I was studying for my graduation in Industrial Mechatronics at the Federal Institute of Cear√° (Cedro campus) I had done a discipline in Mobile Robotics. In that discipline, there was a robot called RoboDeck, but it was an expensive robot and we had to program it with a lot of care and were many students for just one robot. So I decided to create a simulation application to help visualize how to use it properly.</p>
<p>I had to develop this library with Python because the robot had a motherboard running a Linux system, and it was easy to migrate the code from the simulation to the robot. The virtual robot in my simulation needed to have the main features of the real bot to permit the execution of all activities like enabling traction and servo motors and using ultrasound sensors.</p>
<p>I used the PyGame library to draw the scenario and the robot, this way I also programmed a feature to modify the scene using a mouse. I developed the whole project like a Python package so we could easily extend the simulation and create several behaviors and robot architectures.</p>
<p>The project was utilized by other students to enhance their skills in mobile robotics architecture. I implemented the Reactor-Planner architecture and published a paper in a scientific journal.</p>
