<p>This project started in 2017 as a remastering of Lubuntu 16.04 using Windows 10 themes. Several versions were produced such as: 8GB Proinfo projectors version, multiterminal legacy version and others. In version 18.04 the distro development migrated to use bash script with chroot tool. Package distribution started to be done via debian repository using the reprepro tool. Educational version and on-demand to CREDE17 were produced.</p>
<p>I learned several things in this project like using tools: chroot, reprepro, dpkg-deb, respin and resmastersys.</p>
