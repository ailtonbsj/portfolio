<p>Every year at the Federal Institute of Cear√° (Cedro campus) there was an educational fair with several courses with certifications, lectures, publication of scientific papers and robotics competitions. I worked there in 2012 and 2013 as a Full Stack developer with PHP and MySQL.</p>
<p>I was responsible for developing the entire web system for the event.</p>
<p>So I built the landing page, download area, registration page, authentication login system and others extras pages.</p>
<p>I programmed the whole modules of the PHP application, like: module of enroll to course, competitions and publication of papers; module to generate certification in PDF and administration areas.</p>
<p>The administration and users was able to know if there was collision of some course or competition. I also designed some logo of event.</p>
<p>In 2012, more than 400 users were registered on the platform, 40 courses, 25 articles and 30 robotics teams. In 2013, more than 1000 students registered and 60 courses were offered.
The deployment of application was done with FTP and phpMyAdmin for access MySQL database.</p>
