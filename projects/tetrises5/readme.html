<p>When I started programing Javascript it was used just to validated forms and create some animations on cursors, there was nothing about create games or simulations in those days.</p>
<p>So I had an idea to create a clone of Tetris game just for fun using HTML elements (just divs), CSS version 2 and vanilla JS.</p>
<p>I thought for a while how the best way to do it, and took a weekend to build the first version.</p>
<p>It was amazing! It was the first time I thought javascript as an oriented object programming language. I had to code the collision logic of blocks and how javascript could manipulate DOM to render objects while was controlled by keyboard. After that I created another games in HTML like Snake, MineSweeper and Ball Sort.</p>
<p>In 2018 I built a version 2.0 from scratch just for study of EcmaScript 5 Oriented Object. This time I used Browserify to generate the bundle and I applied the prototype pattern on project. I also used Cordova to built an Android package and sent to Google Play.</p>
